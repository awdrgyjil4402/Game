# Penguins
### One of the largest games I have ever made

---

Penguins is a game made over a year during the toughest parts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It was originally a project I had decided to create to entertain my family, but the game
has grown since. It mainly uses the Python and the Pygame library.

The idea behind the simplistic gameplay was to defeat all the enemies every map.
